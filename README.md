# API Commons Interface License
This is the repository for managing the schema applied to the licensing of interfaces, providing a machine-readable way to express the licensing for using an API and it's supporting elements.

## API Commons
This schema is provided as one of many machine-readable schema which are managed as part of the [API Commons](http://apicommons.org/), providing reusable and openly licensed building blocks of API operations.

## Oracle vs Google API Copyright
It is [legal precedent in the United States that APIs are copyrightable](https://apievangelist.com/2021/04/13/My-oracle-vs-google-api-copyright-journey/), and shortly after the case emerged in 2010, API Commons was created to provide a machine-readable way to express the licensing for your API.

## Version 1.0
Version 1.0 of the API Commons Interface License was published in 2014, and can still be used to express a single license to your API.

- V1 JSON Schema ([JSON](interface-license-v1-schema.json)) ([YAML](interface-license-v1-schema.yaml))
- Example ([JSON](interface-license-v1-example.json)) ([YAML](interface-license-v1-example.yaml))

## Version 2.0
Version 2.0 of the API Commons Interface License has been recently published and expanded to allow for the nuance between your API, data, as well as server and client code.

- V1 JSON Schema ([JSON](interface-license-v1-schema.json)) ([YAML](interface-license-v1-schema.yaml))
- Example ([JSON](interface-license-v1-example.json)) ([YAML](interface-license-v1-example.yaml))
